# Code a minigame about rock, paper, scissors in Python where the user plays against the computer and each round the player is asked to choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer chooses randomly. After a round is over, the user should be asked if they want to play again. If they do, the game starts over. If they donâ€™t, the game ends and the final scores are printed. The game should keep track of the score during the game and print it out after each round. The game should also keep track of the number of rounds played. The game should end when the user chooses to stop playing. The game should also print out the number of rounds played at the end of the game.
